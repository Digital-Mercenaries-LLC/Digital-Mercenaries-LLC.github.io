**Absolutely!**

We encourage open communication and collaboration between mentors and mentees.
You can discuss your specific areas of interest, goals, and challenges with
your mentor, and together, you can create a customized learning plan that
focuses on the topics and skills that are most relevant and beneficial to you.
