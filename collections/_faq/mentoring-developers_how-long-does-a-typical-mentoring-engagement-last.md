The duration of a mentoring engagement can vary depending on your specific
needs and goals.  We offer flexible mentoring arrangements that can range from
short-term focused sessions to longer-term engagements spanning several months.
The length of the mentoring program will be determined in consultation with you
to ensure it aligns with your objectives.
