Your safety and privacy are our top priorities at {{ site.title }}.  Disabling
the camera during consultations is part of our commitment to ensuring a secure
and comfortable environment for our clients, partners, and teammates.

This policy is in place to protect everyone involved by minimizing potential
risks, including the unintentional disclosure of Personally Identifiable
Information (PII), which could lead to issues like harassment or stalking.
Additionally, it helps prevent any claims of discrimination and ensures that
the focus remains on the content and objectives of the consultation.

We understand the importance of open communication and strive to create a safe
and productive space for our interactions.  If you have any concerns or
questions about this policy, please feel free to discuss them with your
dedicated Mercenary during the consultation, and we will do our best to address
them.
