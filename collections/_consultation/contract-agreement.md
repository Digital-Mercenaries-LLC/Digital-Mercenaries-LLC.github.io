If our Mercenary determines that they're an adequate fit for your project, a
second consultation will be scheduled to discuss the specific details of the

During this meeting your Mercenary will; address any remaining questions,
negotiate a compensation structure that aligns with your budget and time
requirements, and finalize the contract agreement.
