If our agent determines that we are the right fit for your project, a second
consultation will be scheduled to discuss the specific details of the work to
be performed.  During this meeting, we will address any remaining questions,
negotiate a compensation structure that aligns with your budget and
requirements, and finalize the contract agreement.
